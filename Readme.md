## Installation

```sh
npm install @etchteam/storybook-addon-css-variables-theme --save-dev
```

## Configuration

Create a file called `main.js` in your storybook config.

Add the following content to it:

```js
module.exports = {
  addons: ['@etchteam/storybook-addon-css-variables-theme'],
};
```

Next, create a file called `preview.js` in your storybook config.

You will need to import your style files with some some inline loader options. Specifically you will need to call `style-loader` with `?injectType=lazyStyleTag` to it doesn't run the CSS immediately. After than you can chain your preferred CSS/SCSS/Less/etc loaders.

```js
import light from '!!style-loader?injectType=lazyStyleTag!css-loader!../src/scss/light.css'
import dark from '!!style-loader?injectType=lazyStyleTag!css-loader!../src/scss/dark.css'
```

Import the decorator from the CSS Variables Theme addon

```js
import cssVariablesTheme from '@etchteam/storybook-addon-css-variables-theme'

export const decorators = [
  cssVariablesTheme,
];
```

Then pass the CSS files to the addon via the exported parameters.

```js
export const parameters = {
  cssVariables: {
    files: {
      light,
      dark,
    }
  }
}
```
